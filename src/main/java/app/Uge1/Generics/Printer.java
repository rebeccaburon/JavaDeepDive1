 *  thingToPrint.eat();
 * This is called bouned generic. This can be used for inheritance and interfaces
 *
 * If you wanna expand the bouned generic, you just add a &: public class Printer <T extends Animal & Serializable>
 *     OBS - you can only have one class, and that has to stand firs, then after you can add on Interfaces.
